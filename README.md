Python Basic Concepts Assignments

This repository contains two simple Python scripts designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts as part of Module 2: Basic Python Concepts. Each script is self-contained and solves a specific problem.
Programs Included

Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations (math_operations.py)

Task 2: Personalized Greeting (personalized_greeting.py)
Functionality


Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations

This program functions as a simple command-line calculator.
Features:
Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
Accepts both integers and floating-point (decimal) numbers.
Performs four basic mathematical operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)**

Includes a safety check to prevent a "division by zero" error.
Displays the results of each operation in a clear, formatted way.


Task 2: Personalized Greeting

This program demonstrates basic string manipulation and user interaction.
Features:
Asks the user for their first name and last name separately.
Concatenates (joins) the first name, a space, and the last name to create a full name.
Prints a friendly, personalized greeting message to the user using their full name.
